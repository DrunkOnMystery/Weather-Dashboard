# Weather-Dashboard
A dashboard for weather data pulling from multiple other sources

The goal of this project was to use Jquery and local storage to create an interactive weather dashboard that was capable of saving a user's entries and creating re-usable buttons from them that could be used to repeat searches. 

With each search, a current forecast and a five day future forecast would be shown, with each piece of information being pulled from a set of weather APIs from openweather using ajax.
